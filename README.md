# BrainStation Data Science Capstone Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Forecasting Household Electricity Usage
=========================

### Executive Summary

This project combines time series forecasting and pattern recognition to analyze residential electricity use. Using machine learning, we develop models for short-term consumption prediction and detect daily usage patterns


ðŸ”Ž Project Overview

### Demo

... Show your work:
...     Data visualizations
...     Interactive demo (e.g., `streamlit` app)
...     Short video of users trying out the solution


### Methodology

... High-level diagrams of entire process:
...     various data processing steps
...     various modelling directions
...     various prototyping directions


### Organization
